              <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
              <br>
              I want to start my own business focused on leveraging technology to support educators teach students to read. Given my professional background prior to this I want to make ed-tech that is actually built with educators at the helm.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning.</strong>
              <br>
              I’m generally a self-starter, I have high-expectations of myself, want to get a lot from this course and do an outstanding job so will be organised to do so. This also tips into obsessing over very insignificant or marginal details because if I don’t feel good with what I’m outputting I’m unlikely 
              to even output it. This can slow me down.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
              <br>
              I hope to just broaden my experience working with people from all walks of life.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Managing the workload</strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              Keep it respectful, provide space for others to speak before me, be sincere and constructive in engaging with everyone, receive feedback graciously and provide it respectfully.
              <br>
              <br>
              When things build up, take a step back, write the things down so they aren’t in my head but on paper - I generally find this makes mental mountains feel much smaller and more achievable. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Seeking help. I’ll check in with our group facilitator. My wife is a wonderful sounding board.
              <br>
              <br>
              From the facilitation team, it’d be cool to have a semi-regular one on one check in, but otherwise just being available and being receptive to feedback, thoughts etc. would be ace.
              <br>
              <br>
              Scheduling concerns. My main concern here is the mornings. I am generally responsible for dropping off my little one to day care - I try to get this done by 0815 and be at my desk by 0830 but lately with the general tussling and cajoling in the morning it’s been closer to 0845 drop off - at desk by 0900. I’m wondering if in these situations I can jump on the morning 0845 call from the car or something. My wife and I are working on trying to get things going a bit earlier but it can be a bit touch and go with a 3 year old ha.
