              <strong>1996.</strong>
              	

What a time to be alive! Grunge was hitting its peak, cementing Gen-X counter-commercial irony as the "vibe" of the decade, The Craft had just hit cinemas causing to a teenage girl led witchcraft revival, and David Foster Wallace had just released Infinite Jest - a satirical, maximalist takedown of Western Society's slide into a TV and pharmaceutical induced palliative state, important reading to be sure, except the thing was like 1000 pages long so nobody actually read it.
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and Tipper Gore - wife of Vice-President Al Gore - horrified at discovering her 11-year-old listening to Prince, led a crusade against "obscene music", culminating in <a class="read-more" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Parental_Advisory_label.svg/440px-Parental_Advisory_label.svg.png" target="_blank">this iconic sticker</a> being plastered on albums and, inadvertently, driving up sales of obscene music world wide. 
A Tipper Gore led revival of obscenity, if you will. 
<br>
<br>
(Also, if I walked in and found my 11-year-old daughter listening to Prince, I wouldn't be horrified, I'd just be intimidated.)
<br>
<br>
Anyway, while moody teenagers listened to Black Hole Sun and pretended to read Infinite Jest, my babysitter practised Wicca, and Tipper's daughter grooved to Purple Rain, a bunch of brainiacs over in Switzerland were getting together at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and trying to figure out how to make the internet not look, well, shit.
<br>
<br>
The solution was created, as they pretty much always are, by a Norwegian. Enter Håkon Wium Lie, deciding to take a short break from his hobbies of woodworking, and permaculture, Håkon, invented Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 
<br>
<br>
Yes, Håkon is to the internet, what <a class="read-more" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPBOZCu1kH6CIRG/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Lester Freeman</a> was to The Baltimore Police Department in The Wire.  
<br>
<br>
In 1996, Håkon and his <s>horde of vikings</s> team of engineers rolled out a major new update for CSS that would radically change the way the internet looked and create the visual framework for essentially every website and mobile app in existence. 
<br>
<br>
No biggie.
<br>
<br>
And, in typically verbacious software engineer style, they would give this revolutionary new innovation a truly extravegant name:
<br>
<br>
<span class="box-word">box</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="subtitle">"We just make boxes here..."</span>
<br>
<br>
Fun fact: <a class="read-more" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBprQffr2g4" target="_blank">here is an  scene from inside CERN where the box model was invented.</a>
Prior to the CSS Box Model websites more or less just looked like <a class="read-more" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee’s debut website.</a>
<br>
<br>
CSS Box Model was revolutionary because it established that from there on out all HTML elements would be considered 
<span class="box" style="border-style:'solid .75px black';">“boxes”</span> with the five changeable dimensions:
<br>
<br>
  1. Height
  <br>
  2. Width
  <br>
  3. Padding
  <br>
  4. Border
  <br>
  5. Margin
<br>
<br>
Height and width of each box is kinda self-explanatory (although as you scratch on those topics, turns out they actually <a class="read-more" href="https://css-tricks.com/exploring-the-complexities-of-width-and-height-in-css/" target="_blank">aren’t.</a>)
<br>
<br>
<strong>Border</strong> is also kinda obvious – it refers to any kind of line (solid, dotted, dashed...) surrounding the “box”.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Padding</strong> is the space between the border of the box and the content within the box.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Margin</strong> is the space around the border of the box.
<br>
<br>
<span class="subtitle">Give Me Some Space!</span>
<br>
<br>
Used well, borders create crisp lines that help to delineate the 2D space on a website and create a sense of order. Padding and margins, added judiciously, can create a sense of harmony, balance and space on the page. 
<br>
<br>
Used poorly, well your website risks ending up looking like Picasso and <a class="read-more" href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">The Yale School of Art's website's</a> love-child.
<br>
<br>
Hmmm, that would actually be kinda rad.
