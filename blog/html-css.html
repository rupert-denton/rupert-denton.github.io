              <br>
              Grunge, vanguarded by the likes of Nirvana, Screaming Trees, Soundgarden, continues its doomed insurgency against the goliath commercial music industry, aided by heavyweights like David Foster Wallace who just dropped his gargantuan opus Infinite Jest; a literary right hook against society’s deadening TV induced hypnosis.

              <br>
              Arrayed against the flannel and bandana clad irony-guerillas of Generation-X is the outrage brigade (OB), proto-Karens if you will. 
              
              The OB is led by Tipper Gore, horrified, having found her daughter listening to Darling Nicki by Prince. The OB knock doors, write letters and lobby regulators in pursuit of some sort of warning label to stop kids accidentally listening to people from Seattle.

              The result of this campaign? <a class="read-more" href="https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/09/2000px-Parental_Advisory_label.svg_-1038x576.png" target="_blank">The most badass sticker of the 1990s.</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              At the same time, somewhere in the depths of CERN, the team working on the now two year old Cascading Style Sheets – developed by the organic farmer, woodworker and software developer, Håkon Wium Lie – is rolling out new features that would come to be known as the CSS Box Model and revolutionise the way web pages are structured and displayed. 
              Prior to the CSS Box Model websites more or less just looked like <a class="read-more" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee’s debut website.</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              CSS Box Model was revolutionary because it established from there on out all HTML elements would be considered “boxes” with the five changeable dimensions:
              <br>
              <br>
                1. Height & Width
                <br>
                2. Padding
                <br>
                3. Border
                <br>
                4. Margin
              <br>
              <br>
              Height and width of each box is kinda self-explanatory – although as you scratch on those topics, turns out they actually aren’t. 
              <br>
            
              <strong>Border</strong> is also kinda obvious – it refers to any kind of line (solid, dotted, dashed...) surrounding the “box”.
              <br>
              
              <strong>Padding</strong> is the space between the border of the box and the content within the box.
              <br>
             
              <strong>Margin</strong> is the space around the border of the box.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Give Me Some Space!</strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              Neat borders create crisp lines that help to delineate the 2-dimensional plane of a website and create a sense of order, while padding and margins, added judiciously, can create a sense of harmony, balance and space on the page. 
              <br>
              <br>
              As Tipper Gore learned the hard way by unwittingly rolling out an incredibly cool looking sticker that just ended up boosting sales of “obscene” music, how something looks communicates a lot. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Putting thought into padding/margins/borders stop the user and your message from getting lost.
              <br>
              <br>
              Don’t be like Tipper Gore. Keep thoughtful on design, and enjoy whatever music you like.
