              <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong>
              <br>
              I am critically minded, value irreverence, but sometimes I can do both these things to a fault.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong>
              <br>
              It’s important to be empathic and self-aware for both yourself, being kind to yourself in an inherently challenging field is important. But so is being kind to others, listening well and being receptive to feedback.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
              <br>
              I appreciate how much thought has gone into it. It doesn’t seem tacked on our lip-servicey but a genuinely well thought out component of the curriculum.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong>
              <br>
              I have done a lot of this stuff with my work in education, I often don’t like the “pop” stuff like Dweck etc. it can feel a bit corporate-y but it is useful short hand for things too, so reining in my critical mindset was important. A lot of people get comfort/direction etc. from things like Growth mindset - I shouldn’t let me own reflexive skepticism (not about the core wisdom of it but more about the branding and dot-pointification of that wisdom that can serve to shear away the important, challenging, complex stuff in favour of “takeaways”), get in the way of people appreciating and engaging with it.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong>
              <br>
              As has been said, someone’s disposition/affect is massively important when it comes to working in teams in organisations. But it is also very important when you’re ramping up your skillset from 0 - 100 to be self-aware, kind and mindful about yourself and the bumps you will hit on the way.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
              <br>
              No, never. It is always interesting and good to reflect on these things. I got more out of it by going and reading all the criticisms of some of the stuff like neuroplasticity etc. I often find I get more of an answer of “how one should be” not from the orthodox stuff but from the kind of critical literature/writing around the orthodox stuff that point to what is being missed, over-simplified, or over-complicated and polished up for Harvard Business Review/The Economist readers.
